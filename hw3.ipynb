    "From the histograms, I can see some clear differences between the <=50K and >50K income groups. Age is one of the most obvious. The distribution for >50K skews older, while <=50K peaks more strongly in the younger ranges. This makes sense since higher income is often associated with more years of experience. For capital gain and capital loss, the plots show that both groups are mostly at zero, but the rare non-zero spikes are much more common in the >50K class. That suggests these features could be strong indicators even though they are sparse. Education.num also shows a clear separation; the >50K group tends to cluster at higher education levels, while <=50K is concentrated at lower ones. Hours per week follows a similar trend—although both classes peak around 40 hours, the >50K group has more people working beyond 40, suggesting longer work weeks may be linked to higher income. On the other hand, fnlwgt looks almost identical across the two classes, which implies it might not contribute much predictive value. Overall, these plots highlight that age, education, and work hours provide meaningful separation between the classes, while fnlwgt does not, and capital gain/loss—despite being zero for most people—could be useful for distinguishing higher earners when they do appear."

    "workclass → imputation, one-hot encoding: Workclass is a categorical feature with some missing values (e.g., “?”). We need to handle those missing entries, and since the categories don’t have an inherent order, one-hot encoding is the right way to represent them.\n",
    "\n",
    "fnlwgt → drop: This feature represents census sampling weights and doesn’t provide direct predictive power for income in this context. Since it doesn’t carry useful signal for the model, it’s best to drop it.\n",
    "\n",
    "education → ordinal encoding: Education levels follow a natural order (e.g., “Preschool” < “HS-grad” < “Bachelors” < “Masters”). Encoding them as ordered integers captures this ranking without inflating dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "education.num → drop: This is just a numeric version of education level and duplicates the information already captured by the education column. To avoid redundancy, we drop it.\n",
    "\n",
    "marital.status → one-hot encoding: Different marital statuses (e.g., “Married-civ-spouse,” “Divorced,” “Never-married”) don’t have a meaningful order, so one-hot encoding is the most suitable representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "occupation → imputation, one-hot encoding: Like workclass, occupation is categorical and has missing values marked as “?”. After imputation, one-hot encoding makes sense since there is no natural order between occupations.\n",
    "\n",
    "relationship → one-hot encoding: Relationship categories (e.g., “Husband,” “Not-in-family”) are purely nominal, so one-hot encoding is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "race → drop: Race is included in the raw data, but for ethical and fairness reasons, it should be dropped from the model. Using it could lead to biased predictions, so we exclude it.\n",
    "\n",
    "sex → one-hot encoding with binary=True: Sex is a binary categorical variable (“Male,” “Female”), so one-hot encoding with a single binary column is the simplest and most efficient way to encode it.\n",
    "\n",
    "capital.gain → scaling with StandardScaler: Capital gain is numeric but very skewed, with most values at zero and a few very large values. Scaling it ensures the non-zero values don’t dominate the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "capital.loss → scaling with StandardScaler: Similar to capital gain, this feature is numeric, sparse, and skewed. Scaling helps put it on a comparable range with other numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "hours.per.week → scaling with StandardScaler: Hours per week is numeric and measured on a scale different from other numeric features. Scaling prevents it from disproportionately affecting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "native.country → imputation, one-hot encoding: This categorical feature has many categories and some missing values. After imputing, one-hot encoding is appropriate because the categories have no inherent order.\n",

    "1. We can't do it because it leaks information from the test set into the preprocessing step. We should fit the scaler on the training data only and then transform the test data with those same statistics, otherwise our evaluation is biased and won’t reflect real-world performance.\n",
    "2. The Golden Rule is \"don’t learn anything (features, preprocessing, hyperparameters) from the test set\". If we violate it, our reported score will look better than it truly is. So even if the classifier itself doesn’t get worse, our estimate of how good it is becomes unreliable, which can make us pick the wrong model.\n",
    "3. Pipelines prevent data leakage by fitting all preprocessing inside cross-validation folds, and they keep the whole workflow (impute/encode/scale + model) reproducible and deployable with one object. They also make hyperparameter tuning safer, since search methods (e.g., GridSearchCV) can tune both preprocessing and model steps.\n",
    "4. It is appropriate to use it when different columns need different treatments. For example, scale numeric features, ordinal-encode an ordered column, one-hot encode nominal categoricals, and drop others—all in one composite transformer. It’s the right tool to use for heterogeneous tabular data and connects directly into a Pipeline for end-to-end training and CV. Furthermore, it saves a ton of boilerplate code and ensures the right transformer is always applied to the right set of columns."

This tells me that the SVM is doing the best job at generalizing to unseen data, since validation accuracy is really the measure of how well the model is expected to perform in practice.\n",
    "2. When I compare the times, kNN clearly has the shortest fit time, only around 0.023 seconds. That makes sense because kNN doesn’t actually “train” a model, but it just stores the training data. On the other hand, the decision tree is the fastest when it comes to scoring, at about 0.005 seconds. This also makes sense because once a decision tree is trained, prediction is just a matter of following a few splits, which is really quick. The slowest is for RBF SVM, which makes sense given that it trains a model for us.\n",
    "3. The decision tree shows the highest overfitting. Its training accuracy is almost perfect at 0.987, but its validation accuracy drops to 0.813. That big gap is a clear sign of overfitting, meaning it memorized too many details from the training data. On the other hand, the RBF SVM shows the least overfitting. Its training and validation accuracies are basically the same (0.855 vs. 0.852), which means it’s generalizing really well. kNN falls in between, with a smaller but still noticeable gap (0.884 vs. 0.836). Thus, in this case I think RBF SVM is performing teh best and is the best choice."

    "I grid-searched $C \\in \\{0.1, 1, 10, 100\\}$ using a `preprocessor → SVC(kernel=\"rbf\", C=...)` pipeline with stratified 5-fold CV and logged both accuracy and timings. I obsrved that as $C$ increases (i.e., less regularization), the training accuracy rises steadily (0.838 → 0.855 → 0.862 → 0.871), and the validation accuracy also nudges upward, peaking at $C=100$ with \\~0.860 (vs. 0.838, 0.852, 0.858 for the smaller values). The train–val gap grows slightly with larger $C$ (from \\~0.000 at 0.1 to \\~0.011 at 100), but it stays small overall, so overfitting doesn’t look severe here. Timing-wise, fit time increases as $C$ grows (≈1.31s → 1.58s), which is expected since a larger $C$ tightens the margin and makes the optimization harder, while score time actually trends down a bit (≈0.83s → 0.62s). This means there's likely fewer support vectors at higher $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these results, the best cross-validated accuracy is at $C=100$, so I set `best_C = 100.0`. That said, the improvements from $C=1$ to $C=100$ are small and within similar error bars (±\\~0.005–0.006), so if I were being conservative about complexity I could justify $C=1$ as well. For this assignment, though, I’m following the instruction to pick the $C$ with the highest mean CV accuracy.\n"
